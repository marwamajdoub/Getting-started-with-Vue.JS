# 🌟 Getting Started with Vue.js

## Introduction

This repository contains my journey of learning Vue.js. Vue.js is a progressive JavaScript framework used for building user interfaces. The lessons I followed are part of a structured course, and this README provides an overview of what I learned and how I applied it.

## Lessons Overview

### 📦 Lesson 2 - Creating the Vue Application

In this lesson, I learned how to create a new Vue application. The steps involved setting up the development environment and initializing a Vue project using Vue CLI. 

**Key Points:**
- 📥 Installing Vue CLI globally using npm.
- 🏗️ Creating a new Vue project with `vue create my-project`.
- 🗂️ Understanding the project structure and configuration files.

### 🔗 Lesson 3 - Attribute Binding

This lesson focused on attribute binding in Vue. I learned how to dynamically bind HTML attributes to Vue data properties using the `v-bind` directive.

**Key Points:**
- 📎 Using `v-bind` to bind HTML attributes like `src`, `href`, and class names.
- 🔄 Dynamically updating attributes based on Vue instance data.

### 🔄 Lesson 4 - Conditional Rendering

Conditional rendering was covered in this lesson. I learned how to conditionally render elements in the DOM using the `v-if`, `v-else-if`, and `v-else` directives.

**Key Points:**
- 👀 Conditionally displaying elements with `v-if` and `v-else`.
- 👁️ Using `v-show` as an alternative for toggling visibility without removing elements from the DOM.

### 📋 Lesson 5 - List Rendering

In this lesson, I learned about rendering lists of items using the `v-for` directive. This included iterating over arrays and objects.

**Key Points:**
- 🔁 Using `v-for` to loop through arrays and objects.
- 📃 Displaying list data dynamically and understanding the importance of unique keys for list items.

### 🎛️ Lesson 6 - Event Handling

Event handling in Vue was the focus of this lesson. I learned how to listen for and respond to user events using the `v-on` directive.

**Key Points:**
- 🖱️ Binding event listeners to DOM events like `click`, `submit`, etc.
- 🛠️ Methods to handle events and pass event data.

### 🎨 Lesson 7 - Class and Style Binding

This lesson covered class and style binding. I learned how to bind CSS classes and inline styles dynamically based on Vue instance data.

**Key Points:**
- 🎭 Binding classes dynamically with `v-bind:class`.
- 🎨 Binding inline styles dynamically with `v-bind:style`.
- 🖍️ Conditional class and style binding based on data properties.

### 🧮 Lesson 8 - Computed Properties

In this lesson, I learned about computed properties in Vue. Computed properties are used to derive data that depends on other data.

**Key Points:**
- 🧠 Defining computed properties and using them in templates.
- ⚖️ Understanding the difference between computed properties and methods.
- 🚀 Caching computed properties for performance optimization.
